    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive algorithms serve multiple functions in criminal justice. They forecast crime locations, identify potential violent offenders, predict court appearance compliance, and estimate recidivism risk. \n",
    "COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) stands as a prominent risk assessment tool. Since 1998, the COMPAS risk score has been used by many jurisdictions in the United States to assess risk of recidivism in pre-trial bail decisions.\n",
    "In the United States, a defendant may either be detained or released on bail *(sous caution)* prior to the trial in court depending on various factors. Judges may detain defendants or increase the bail amount based on the risk score provided by the COMPAS algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, investigative journalists at ProPublica published [Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing), highlighting significant biases in the COMPAS Algorithm. Specifically, they showed that the proportion of false positives for African-American defendants is significantly higher than for Caucasian defendants. In other words, more African-American were labeled high risk and ended up not relapsing into criminal behaviour than Caucasian defendants. A more thorough explanation of their data analysis procedure can be found in their companion article [How We Analyzed the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The COMPAS algorithm is proprietary software. What is known is that its decision is based on the answers to a questionnaire with 137 questions which the defendant must fill. There are questions related to crime (“How many prior juvenile felony offense arrests?”) along with seemingly mundane ones (“Do you live with friends?”; “Do you feel discouraged at times?”).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hackathon, you are provided a dataset with a subset of answers to that questionnaire from more than 7000 defendants living in Broward County, Florida as well as whether they did relapse into criminal behaviour or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective(s)\n",
    "It has been shown in the article linked above that the COMPAS algorithm is biased. We take this for granted and we do not bother to show it again. The main objective of the hackathon for you is to understand that it is not only the COMPAS algorithm that is biased, but that **the data itself is biased**, in the sense that one can find structural patterns of discrimination embedded in the data. In other words, *learning from data coming from a biased world without precautions will necessarily lead to biased predictions*. Knowing which precautions one should take to avoid biased predictions is a whole subfield of machine learning called \"Fairness in AI\". It is out of the scope of this hackathon and out of the scope of LEPL1109. If you are curious about it however, a great resource is the following book [Fairness and machine learning Limitations and Opportunities](https://fairmlbook.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To see that the data itself is biased, you will implement your own recidivism prediction algorithms and measure their fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset description\n",
    "A large part of this hackathon will be devoted to handling, understanding and manipulating the dataset. The dataset provided represents 7214 defendants (data points) with 49 answers to the questionnaire (features) for each defendant.

    "\n",
    "### Purity\n",
    "\n",
    "Purity measures how well a cluster contains points from a single class. A cluster with high purity mostly contains points from one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Imagine you are grouping fruits based on their shape, but you also have information about their color. If a group contains mostly red apples, that group has high purity. However, if you find a few green apples or pears in the group, the purity decreases. In this case, high purity means the majority of fruits share both shape and color consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Purity } = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^k \\max_j n_{i,j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $N = $ total number of points,\n",
    "- $k = $ number of clusters,\n",
    "- $n_{i,j} = $​ number of points from class $j$ in cluster $i$,\n",
    "- $\\max_j n_{i,j} = $ number of points from the most common class in cluster $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy measures how mixed the classes are within a cluster. Low entropy means most points in a cluster belong to the same class. High entropy means points are more evenly distributed across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider a fruit basket that is mostly filled with red apples, with only a few bananas and oranges. Since the basket is dominated by one type of fruit, it has low entropy. In contrast, if the basket contains an equal mix of apples, bananas, and oranges, the distribution is more random, resulting in high entropy. This even distribution means it is harder to predict the dominant fruit just by looking at the basket.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Formula for a single cluster:***\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_i = -\\sum_{j=1}^{C} p_{ij} \\log_2(p_{ij})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $C = $ number of classes,\n",
    "- $p_{i,j} = $ proportion of points from class jj in cluster ii.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall entropy is the weighted average across all clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Entropy} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i \\cdot E_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n_i$​ is the number of points in cluster $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good clustering aims for both high purity (most points in a cluster belong to one class) and low entropy (each cluster contains little class mixing).\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n",
    " If this makes it easier for you to implement purity and entropy, you can modify the previously defined function `compute_metrics` to also return in the results dictionary the purity, the entropy or any other metric that you may want to use later on.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n",
    " Compared to the silhouette score which is computed using only the features, purity and entropy are metrics computed using the true label `y`. Do not forget to compute these metrics on a test set.\n",
