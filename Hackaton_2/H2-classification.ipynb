    "# **Context & Objective**\n",
    "Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy. After different foods are broken down into sugars during digestion, the sugars are then released into the bloodstream. This signals the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin helps enable cells within the body to use those sugars in the bloodstream for energy. Diabetes is generally characterized by either the body not making enough insulin or being unable to use the insulin that is made as effectively as needed.\\\n",
    "Complications like heart disease, vision loss, lower-limb amputation, and kidney disease are associated with chronically high levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream for those with diabetes. While there is no cure for diabetes, strategies like losing weight, eating healthily, being active, and receiving medical treatments can mitigate the harms of this disease in many patients. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment, making predictive models for diabetes risk important tools for public and public health officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "You work in the diabetology department at **Saint Luc University Hospital**. The head of the department has asked you to find a solution for classifying and predicting **whether patients are at high risk of developing diabetes**. This will enable them to schedule an appointment with these patients to set up prevention tools. To do this, you have a database of patients who have passed through the department in recent years. In addition, the head of the department feels that the poll is too long, and would like to **reduce the number of questions while maintaining the reliability and quality of the results**.\\\n",
    "Your aim is to determine which characteristics are relevant and enable reliable patient classification. Be careful, don’t let a potential diabetic patient slip through the cracks. The rest of this document will guide you in this process.\n",

Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic diseases and use of preventive services. The survey has been conducted annually since 1984. It contains 22 headings and around 70,000 entries.\n",
